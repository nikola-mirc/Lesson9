Your solution to these challenges comprises 100% of your final grade for Java I. You may not use any external libraries. Optional helper methods are provided in the FileHelper class.

Grading will take into account code cleanliness and style, such as clarity of code, naming, commit commments, and use of object oriented design.
Your solution must be published on GitHub. There are so many different ways to solve the challenges, that copying will be obvious, and result in 0 points.
